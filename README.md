# MATH3303LectureNotes
## What is this?
This is made by me, a student in University of Queensland, for the course MATH3303. It is latex version of the lecture notes.
## Why make this?
The content of lecture are only available as what's written on the board and their photo. They are  
-Hand written, which may be hard to read.  
-Poorly formated.
## What else?
It is possible that I made mistake somewhere. You are welcome to point them out. You may also feel free to make pull request if you want.
